Agile methodology

Scrum: (to team member)

-What did you do yesterday?
-What are you gonna do today?
-Is there any blocker? like if your work is depend on other. If they complete their work after only you could able to do your part. Or may
  be you have sent a email to someone and he/she didn't respond, So you couldn't able to do your work. That's call blocker for you. In short
  you stuck in between.
-What is your gut check? like you have assigned to do one or more in certain time limit like one or two week that's call sprint. So in
  that sprint you can able to complete your task or not? what is your gut feeling about it. that's gut check.
